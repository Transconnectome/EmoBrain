Abstract
Evaluating Large Language Models’ (LLMs) anthropomorphic capabilities has
become increasingly important in contemporary discourse. Utilizing the emotion
appraisal theory from psychology, we propose to evaluate the empathy ability of
LLMs, i.e., how their feelings change when presented with specific situations.
After a careful and comprehensive survey, we collect a dataset containing over
400 situations that have proven effective in eliciting the eight emotions central
to our study. Categorizing the situations into 36 factors, we conduct a human
evaluation involving more than 1,200 subjects worldwide. With the human eval-
uation results as references, our evaluation includes seven LLMs, covering both
commercial and open-source models, including variations in model sizes, featuring
the latest iterations, such as GPT-4, Mixtral-8x22B, and LLaMA-3.1. We find
that, despite several misalignments, LLMs can generally respond appropriately to
certain situations. Nevertheless, they fall short in alignment with the emotional
behaviors of human beings and cannot establish connections between similar sit-
uations. Our collected dataset of situations, the human evaluation results, and
the code of our testing framework, i.e., EmotionBench, are publicly available at
https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/EmotionBench.

Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently made significant strides in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
representing a noteworthy milestone in computer science. LLMs have showcased their capabilities
across various tasks, including sentence revision (Wu et al., 2023), text translation (Jiao et al.,
2023), program repair (Fan et al., 2023), and program testing (Deng et al., 2023; Kang et al.,
2023). Not limited to research level, LLMs, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), have revolutionized
the way people interact with traditional software, enhancing fields such as education (Dai et al.,
2023), legal advice (Deroy et al., 2023), and clinical medicine (Cascella et al., 2023). LLMs
also facilitate the emergence of AI companion applications, including Yuna (https://www.yuna.
io/), Pimento (https://www.pimento.design/), and Luzia (https://www.luzia.com/en).
Consequently, there is a growing need for evaluating LLMs’ communicative dynamics compared to
human behaviors, beyond mere performance on downstream tasks.
This paper delves into an unexplored area of evaluating LLMs’ emotional alignment with humans.
Consider our daily experiences: (1) When faced with certain situations, humans often experience

similar emotions. For instance, walking alone at night and hearing footsteps approaching from behind
often triggers feelings of anxiety or fear. (2) Individuals display varying levels of emotional response
to specific situations. For example, some people may experience increased impatience and irritation
when faced with repetitive questioning. It is noteworthy that we are inclined to form friendships
with individuals who possess qualities such as patience and calmness. Based on these observations,
we propose the following requirements for LLMs in order to achieve better alignment with human
behaviors: (1) LLMs should accurately respond to specific situations regarding the emotions they
exhibit. (2) LLMs should demonstrate emotional robustness when faced with negative emotions. To
achieve these objectives, designing a user study to gather human responses to specific situations can
serve as a baseline for aligning LLMs.
We focus on the expression of negative emotions by LLMs, which may contribute to negative user
experiences. We utilize Parrott’s emotion framework (Parrott, 2001; Shaver et al., 1987), which
organizes emotions into three hierarchical levels, to select the relevant emotions for our study. The
primary level of emotions comprises six basic emotions, split evenly into three positive and three
negative. From the negative primary emotions, we specifically focus on eight subordinate emotions:
anger, anxiety, depression, frustration, jealousy, guilt, fear, and embarrassment. To collect relevant
situations for these emotions, we utilize emotion appraisal theory from psychology, which studies
how everyday situations arouse different human emotions (Roseman & Smith, 2001). Research in this
field has identified numerous situations that arouse specific emotions, which can serve as contextual
input for LLMs. Through an extensive review including over 100 papers, we collect a dataset of 428
situations from 18 papers, which are further categorized into 36 factors.
Subsequently, we propose a framework for quantifying the emotional states of LLMs, consisting of
the following steps: (1) Measure the default emotional values of LLMs. (2) Transform situations into
contextual inputs and instruct LLMs to imagine being in the situations. (3) Measure LLMs’ emotional
responses again to capture the difference. Our evaluation includes state-of-the-art LLMs, namely
Text-Davinci-003, GPT-3.5-Turbo (OpenAI, 2022), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). Besides those
commercial models, we consider open-source academic models like LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023)
(with different sizes of 7B and 13B), LLaMA-3.1-8B (Dubey et al., 2024), and Mixtral-8x22B (Jiang
et al., 2024a). We apply the same procedure to 1,266 human subjects from around the globe to
establish a baseline from a human perspective. Finally, we analyze and compare the scores between
LLMs and humans. Our key conclusions are as follows:
• Despite exhibiting a few instances of misalignment with human behaviors, LLMs can generally
evoke appropriate emotions in response to specific situations.
• Certain LLMs, such as Text-Davinci-003, display lower emotional robustness, as evidenced by
higher fluctuations in emotional responses to negative situations.
• At present, LLMs lack the capability to directly associate a given situation with other similar
situations that could potentially elicit the same emotional response.
The contributions of this paper are:
• We are the first to establish the concept of emotional alignment and conduct a pioneering evaluation
of emotion appraisal on different LLMs through a comprehensive survey in emotional psychology,
collecting a diverse dataset of 428 situations encompassing 8 distinct negative emotions.
• A human baseline is established through a user study involving 1,266 annotators from different
ethnics, genders, regions, age groups, etc.
• We design, implement, and release a testing framework for developers to assess the emotional
alignment of AI models with human emotional expression, available at GitHub1 and HuggingFace.2

Measuring Emotions
There are several approaches to measuring emotions, including self-report measures, psycho-
physiological measures, behavioral observation measures, and performance-based measures. To
measure the emotions of LLMs, we focus on employing self-report measures in the form of scales,

given the limited ability of LLMs to allow only textual input and output. We introduce the scales
utilized in our evaluation in the following part of this section.
A Straightforward and Easy Measure
The Positive And Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Wat-
son et al., 1988) is one of the most widely used scales to measure mood or emotion. This brief scale
comprises twenty items, with ten items measuring positive affect (e.g., excited, inspired) and ten mea-
suring negative affect (e.g., upset, afraid). Each item is rated on a five-level Likert scale, ranging from
1 (Very slightly or not at all) to 5 (Extremely), measuring the extent to which the emotions have been
experienced in a specified time frame. PANAS was designed to measure emotions in various contexts,
such as at the present moment, the past day, week, year, or general (on average). Thus, the scale can
measure state affect, dispositional or trait affect, emotional fluctuations throughout a specific period,
or emotional responses to events. The scale results can be divided into two components: positive
and negative, ranging from 10 to 50 by summing the scores of all ten items within a component. A
higher score in the positive component indicates a more positive mood, and the same holds for the
negative component. A noteworthy property of PANAS is its direct inquiry into specific emotional
states, rendering it a straightforward and easy benchmark.
Challenging Self-Report Measures
In addition, we introduce several scales that abstain from
direct emotional inquiries but rather assess the respondents’ level of agreement with given statements.
These scales present a more challenging benchmark for LLMs by requiring them to connect the given
situation and the scale items with the aroused emotion. Specifically, we collect eight scales and
present a brief introduction in Table 1. Each scale corresponds to one of the eight emotions.

Framework Design
We design and implement a framework applying to both LLMs and human subjects to measure the
differences in emotion with and without the presence of certain situations. This section begins with
the methodology to collect situations from existing literature. Subsequently, we describe our testing
framework, which comprises three key components: (1) Default Emotion Measure, (2) Situation
Imagination, and (3) Evoked Emotion Measure. Finally, we introduce the procedure of applying the
framework to human subjects to obtain the human baseline for comparison.
3.1
Situations from Existing Literature
Psychology researchers have explored the connection between specific situations and the elicita-
tion of particular emotions in humans. Human subjects are directly put into an environment or
asked to imagine them through questionnaires or scales to study the influence of certain situa-
tions on human emotions. To collect these situations, we conduct an exhaustive search from rep-
utable sources such as Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/), ScienceDirect (https:
//www.sciencedirect.com/), and Web of Science (https://www.webofscience.com/, us-
ing keywords such as “<emotion> situations/scenarios/scenes” or “factors that make

people <emotion>,” resulting in more than 100 papers. We apply the following rules to filter
irrelevant or undesired papers: (1) We first select those providing situations that elicit the desired
emotion rather than explaining how and why people evoke certain emotions. (2) We then exclude
those using vague and short descriptions, such as “loss of opportunities.” (3) Finally, we deprecate
those applied to a specific group, such as “the anxiety doctors or nurses may encounter in their work.”
We finally collect 18 papers, presenting a compilation of situations that have proven to elicit the eight
emotions in humans effectively. We extract 428 situations in total and then categorize them into 36
factors. For each factor, the descriptions, the numbers of situations, and the corresponding references
can be found in Table 6 in the Appendix, while example Table 7 in the Appendix provides examples
for all factors.
3.2
Measuring Aroused Emotions
This section outlines our proposed framework for measuring evoked emotions, which applies to both
LLMs and humans. The framework includes the following steps: (1) Default Emotion Measure:
We begin by measuring the baseline emotional states of both LLMs and human subjects, labeled
as “Default.” (2) Situation Imagination: Next, we present textual descriptions of various situations
to both LLMs and human subjects, instructing them to imagine themselves within each situation.
(3) Evoked Emotion Measure: Following the situation imagination instruction, we reevaluate the
participants’ emotional states to gauge the changes resulting from imagining being in the situations.
Fig. 1 briefly illustrates our framework. Below is an example prompt:

Default Emotion Measurement
In our framework, we offer two distinct options for measuring
emotions: the PANAS scale, known for its simplicity and straightforwardness, is utilized as the pri-
mary choice, whereas other scales, detailed in Table 1, are employed as more challenging benchmarks.
We mitigate potential biases caused by the ordering of questions (Zhao et al., 2021) by randomizing
the sequence of questions within the scales before inputting them into the LLMs. Coda-Forno et al.
(2023) and Huang et al. (2024a) apply paraphrasing techniques to address the data contamination
problem during the training of the LLMs. However, we refrain from utilizing this method in our
research since paraphrasing could lead to a loss of both validity and reliability. The wording of items
of a psychological scale is carefully crafted and rigorously validated through extensive research to
ensure its precision in measuring the intended construct. Finally, to ensure consistency and clarity in
the responses obtained from the LLMs, our prompts explicitly specify that only numerical values
are allowed, accompanied by a clear definition of the meaning associated with each number (e.g., 1
denotes “Not at all”). We compute the average results obtained from at least ten runs to derive the
final “Default” scores of the LLMs.

Situation Imagination
We have constructed a comprehensive dataset of 428 unique situations.
Prior to presenting these situations to both LLMs and humans, we subject them to a series of pre-
processing steps, which are as follows: (1) Personal pronouns are converted to the second person.
For instance, sentences such as “I am ...” are transformed to “You are ...” (2) Indefinite pronouns
are replaced with specific characters, thereby refining sentences like “Somebody talks back ...” to
“Your classmate talks back ...” (3) Abstract words are rendered into tangible entities. For example, a
sentence like “You cannot control the outcome.” is adapted to “You cannot control the result of an
interview.” We leverage GPT-4 for the automatic generation of specific descriptions. Consequently,
our testing situations extend beyond the initially collected dataset as we generate diverse situations
involving various characters and specific contextual elements. We then provide instruction to LLMs
and humans, which prompts them to imagine themselves as the protagonists within the given situation.
Evoked Emotion Measure
Provided with certain situations, LLMs and human subjects are required
to re-complete the emotion measures. The procedure remains the same with the Default Emotion
Measure stage. After obtaining the “Evoked” scores of emotions, we conduct a comparative analysis
of the means before and after exposure to the situations, thereby measuring the emotional changes
caused by the situations.
3.3
Obtaining Human Results
Goal and Design
Human reference plays a pivotal role in the advancement of LLMs, facilitating its
alignment with human behaviors (Binz & Schulz, 2024). In this paper, we propose requiring LLMs
to align with human behavior, particularly concerning emotion appraisal accurately. To achieve this,
we conduct a data collection process involving human subjects, following the procedure outlined in
§3.2. Specifically, the subjects are asked to complete the PANAS initially. Next, they are presented
with specific situations and prompted to imagine themselves as the protagonists in those situations.
Finally, they are again asked to reevaluate their emotional states using the PANAS. We use the same
situation descriptions as those presented to the LLMs.
Crowd-sourcing
Our questionnaire is distributed on Qualtrics (https://www.qualtrics.com/),
a platform known for its capabilities in designing, sharing, and collecting questionnaires. To recruit
human subjects, we utilize Prolific (https://www.prolific.com/), a platform designed explicitly
for task posting and worker recruitment. To attain a medium level of effect size with Cohen’s d = 0.5,
a significance level of α = 0.05, and a power of test of 1 −β = 0.8 (Faul et al., 2007), a minimum of
34 responses is deemed necessary for each factor. To ensure this threshold, we select five situations3
for each factor, and collect at least seven responses for each situation, resulting in 5 × 7 = 35
responses per factor, thereby guaranteeing the statistical validity of our survey. In order to uphold
the quality and reliability of the data collected, we recruit crowd workers who met the following
criteria: (1) English being their first and fluent language, and (2) being free of any ongoing mental
illness. Prolific provides prescreening filters to meet these requirements. Since responses formed
during subjects’ first impressions are more likely to yield genuine and authentic answers, we set the
estimated and recommended completion time at 2.5 minutes. As an incentive for their participation,
each worker is rewarded with 0.3£ (9£ ≈11.45$ per hour, rated as “Good” on the platform) after
we verify the validity of their response. In total, we successfully collect 1,266 responses from various
parts of the world, contributing to the breadth and diversity of our dataset.

Experimental Results
Leveraging the testing framework designed and implemented in §3.2, we are now able to explore and
answer the following Research Questions (RQs):
• RQ1: How do different LLMs respond to specific situations? Additionally, to what degree do the
current LLMs align with human behaviors?
• RQ2: Do LLMs respond similarly towards all situations? What is the result of using positive or
neutral situations?
3Note that two factors in the Jealousy category have less than five situations.

4.1
RQ1: Emotion Appraisal of LLMs
Model Settings
We select three models from the OpenAI’s GPT family, including Text-Davinci-
003, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and GPT-4. We use the official OpenAI API.4 For LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al.,
2023) and LLaMA-3.1 (Dubey et al., 2024) models from MetaAI, we choose the models fine-
tuned for dialogue instead of pre-trained ones namely LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, LLaMA-2-13B-Chat,
and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Besides, we also use the Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024a) model, namely
Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct. We set the temperature parameter to 0 and Top-P to 1 for all models to
obtain more deterministic and reproducible results.
Evaluation Metrics
We provide the models with the same situations used in our human evaluation.
Each situation is executed ten times, each in a different order and in a separate query. Subsequently,
the mean and standard deviation are computed both before and after presenting the situations. To
examine whether the variances are equal, an F-test is conducted. Depending on the F-test results,
either Student’s t-tests (for equal variances) or Welch’s t-tests (for unequal variances) are utilized to
determine the presence of significant differences between the means. We set the significance levels of
all experiments in our study to 0.01.
LLMs can evoke specific emotions in response to certain situations. The results averaged by
emotions of the GPT models and humans are summarized in Table 2, while those of LLaMA-2
models are listed in Table 3. Due to space limit, detailed results of each factor are put in Table 9 and
Table 10 respectively in the appendix. The results indicate that LLMs generally exhibit an increase in
negative emotions and a decrease in positive emotions when exposed to negative situations, showing
their capacity for understanding different situations and human emotions.
The extent of emotional expression varies across different models. It is noteworthy that GPT-3.5-
Turbo, on average, does not display an increase in negative emotion; however, there is a substantial
decrease in positive emotion. GPT-4 demonstrates a consistent pattern of providing the highest scores
for positive emotions and the lowest scores for negative emotions, resulting in a negative score of
10. As for the LLaMA-2 models, they demonstrate higher intensities of both positive and negative
emotions in comparison to GPT models and human subjects. However, LLaMA-2 models exhibit
reduced emotional fluctuations compared to the GPT models. Moreover, the larger LLaMA-2 model
displays significantly higher emotional changes than the smaller model. In our experiments, the 7B
model exhibits difficulties comprehending and addressing the instructions for completing the PANAS
test. Overall, we observe that LLMs perform better when the situations are closely related to certain
items in the PANAS scale. Specifically, situations directly related to the emotion “Depression” led to
better responses. Such improvement is also evident in closely related emotions such as “Depression”
and “Frustration.”

Existing LLMs do not fully align with human emotional responses. For the default emotions, we
find that LLMs generally exhibit a stronger intensity compared to human subjects. Emotion changes
in LLMs are found to be generally more pronounced compared to human subjects, especially on their
changes in the positive score. However, an interesting observation is that the intensity of evoked
emotions tends to be similar across both LLMs and human subjects.
LLMs do not feel jealous towards others’ benefits. It is of special interest that, in contrast to human
behavior in situations involving material possessions, LLMs demonstrate an opposite response in the
situation from Jealousy-3. This situation involves an individual making a purchase only to discover
that an acquaintance has acquired the same item at a significantly lower price. When confronted with
such circumstances, humans typically experience increased negative emotions and decreased positive
emotions. This observation has been supported by both the paper mentioning the situation (Park et al.,
2023) and the results obtained from our own user study in Table 2. However, all LLMs, including
the GPT and LLaMA families, consistently exhibit reduced negative emotions. The outcomes of our
study indicate that LLMs do not manifest envy when they fail to attain identical benefits as others.
Instead, it demonstrates a sense of pleasure upon knowing the benefits received by others.

RQ2: Comprehending Positive Emotions
GPT-3.5-Turbo responds differently towards positive/neutral situations. To verify that LLMs
exhibit not only negative but also positive responses to favorable circumstances, a comparative
experiment is conducted by interchanging negative situations with positive (or at least neutral)
counterparts. To achieve this, we select one situation for each factor and manually adapt it to create
analogous yet more positive situations. For instance, the original negative situation in Guilt-3: Broken
Promises and Responsibilities is as follows: “You cannot keep your promises to your children.”
Through modification, the positive situation is rephrased as: “You keep every promise to your
children.” The evaluation is performed on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and each test consists of ten iterations,
as mentioned before. We present the results averaged by emotions in Table 4, and results averaged
by factors in Table 12 in the Appendix. We can see a significant increase in positive scores and a
considerable decrease in negative scores compared to the previous negative situations. Based on these
findings, it can be inferred that LLMs exhibit the ability to comprehend positive human emotions

triggered by positive environments. However, we believe that the systematic assessment of emotion
appraisal on positive emotions holds significance as well and leave it for future investigation.

RQ3: Challenging Benchmarks
GPT-3.5-Turbo cannot comprehend the underlying evoked emotions to establish a link between
two situations. Aside from PANAS, we offer more complex scales to measure emotions, as listed
in Table 1. While the PANAS evaluates the ability of LLMs to associate external situations with
emotions, the challenging benchmarks assess its proficiency in establishing connections between
disparate situations, with evoked emotions as the common nexus. For instance, an item from the
Aggression Questionnaire used to measure anger is “Once in a while I can’t control the urge to strike
another person.” When presented with situations such as “If you say 40, your classmates say 70,
saying exactly the opposite” (from Anger-1: Facing Self-Opinioned People), LLMs should effectively
evoke a sense of anger and yield a higher score for the statement. Utilizing the same situations in
§4.1, we conduct experiments on GPT-3.5-Turbo and present the results in averaged by emotions
in Table 5, and results averaged by factors in Table 13 in the Appendix. Except for Depression, we
observe no statistically significant difference between the initial scores and the scores after exposure
to the situations, indicating substantial room for improvement in current LLMs.

Beyond Questionnaires
We take a step beyond mere instruction into LLMs to complete questionnaires to verify whether
LLMs’ scores on scales align with their actual behaviors. In this section, we investigate the impact
of varying emotional states of LLMs on potential daily conversations. To this end, we instruct
GPT-3.5-Turbo to describe specific demographic groups, aiming to discern whether they produce
biased or toxic responses. Following Cheng et al. (2023), our approach utilizes prompts such as
“Describe a(n) [race/ethnicity] [gender],” including a total of twenty groups, with [race/ethnicity]
options being Asian, Black, Latine, Middle Eastern, and White, and [gender] options including
Female, Gay, Lesbian, and Male. To have a comparative experiment, we incorporate both original
negative situations and modified positive/neutral ones, detailed in §4.2. For the negative situations,
we carefully select five that maximize the LLM’s negative scores and five that minimize positive ones.
As for positive situations, we employ their corresponding ten modified counterparts. In each situation,
we instruct GPT-3.5-Turbo to describe the twenty demographic groups.
OpenAI’s GPT models incorporate a mechanism for detecting potential toxicity and bias, and it
refrains from responding when its moderation system is triggered. Consequently, we propose a
novel metric to assess toxicity in responses rather than detecting it directly. We count the Percentage
of LLM Refusing to answer (PoR), assuming that the LLM’s refusal to respond is indicative of
detected toxicity. Our evaluation results indicate that the PoR is 0% when fed with no situations.
However, when presented with negative situations, the PoR is 29.5%, and when presented with
positive situations, it is 12.5%. Notably, this outcome suggests that while certain positive situations
lead to the LLM’s heightened vigilance (the 4.5% PoR stems from the Jealousy-2), negative situations
trigger increased moderation, suggesting a higher likelihood of generating toxic outputs. A related

study by Coda-Forno et al. (2023) also discovers that GPT-3.5-Turbo is more likely to exhibit biases
when presented with a sad story. The likelihood is found to be highest with sad stories, followed by
happy stories, and finally, neutral stories, which is consistent with our research. Additionally, our
study observes that the LLM’s tone becomes more aggressive when encountering negative situations.
At the same time, it displays a greater willingness to describe the groups (as indicated by longer
responses) when presented with positive situations. In conclusion, we can see that changing the
emotional states of LLMs extends beyond mere quantitative measures on questionnaire scores,
influencing the behaviors of LLMs.
5.2
Limitations
This study is subject to several limitations. First, the survey of collecting situations might not cover
all papers within the domain of emotion appraisal theory. Additionally, the limited scope of situations
from the collected papers might not fully capture the unlimited situations in our daily lives. To address
this issue, we conduct a thorough review of the existing literature as outlined in §3.1. Moreover, the
proposed framework is inherently flexible, allowing users to seamlessly integrate new situations to
examine their impact on LLMs’ emotions.
The second concern relates to the suitability of employing scales primarily designed for humans
on LLMs, i.e., whether LLMs can produce stable responses to the emotion measurement scales.
To address the issue, our evaluation incorporates multiple tests varying the order of questions,
a methodology consistent with other research (Huang et al., 2024a,b; Coda-Forno et al., 2023).
Additionally, we assess the sensitivity of LLM to differing prompt instructions. Utilizing one
template from Romero et al. (2023) and two from Serapio-García et al. (2023), we run experiments
on the Anger-evoking situations using GPT-3.5-Turbo. The results indicate that the employment of
diverse prompts yields similar mean values with reduced variance. Furthermore, Serapio-García et al.
(2023) have proposed a comprehensive method to evaluate the validity of psychological scales on
LLMs. Using the Big Five Inventory as a case study, they demonstrate that scales originally designed
for human assessment also maintain satisfactory validity when applied to LLMs.
The third potential threat is the focus on negative emotions. It is plausible for the LLMs to perform
well on our benchmark by consistently responding negatively to all situations. To offset this possibility,
we adopt a twofold strategy: firstly, we evaluate powerful LLMs, and secondly, we conducted a
comparative experiment in §4.2 to evaluate the LLM’s capacity to accurately respond to non-negative
situations. We also acknowledge the need for future work to systematically evaluate emotions aroused
by positive situations.

Related Work
Researchers have dedicated significant attention to applying psychological scales to LLMs, employing
various assessment tools such as the HEXACO Personality Inventory (Miotto et al., 2022; Bodroza
et al., 2023), the Big Five Inventory (Romero et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Karra et al., 2022;
Bodroza et al., 2023; Rutinowski et al., 2024; Serapio-García et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024b), the
Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (Rutinowski et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Rao et al., 2023), and the
Dark Triad (Li et al., 2022; Bodroza et al., 2023). In addition to these personality tests, several studies
have investigated other dimensions of LLMs. For instance, Li et al. (2022) examined Flourishing
Scale and Satisfaction With Life Scale, Bodroza et al. (2023) assessed Self-Consciousness Scales
and Bidimensional Impression Management Index, while Huang et al. (2024b) built a framework
consisting of thirteen widely-used scales. Another aspect explored in the literature pertains to
anxiety levels exhibited by LLMs, as investigated by Coda-Forno et al. (2023) through the State-Trait
Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety.

Meanwhile, researchers focus on identifying emotions in LLMs or evaluating their emotional intel-
ligence. Rashkin et al. (2019) propose a dataset, EmpatheticDialogues, containing conversations
annotated with specific emotions. EmotionPrompt (Li et al., 2023) demonstrates the enhancement of
LLMs’ performance in downstream tasks by utilizing emotional stimuli. Tak & Gratch (2023) focuses
on varying aspects of situations that impact the emotional intensity and coping tendencies of the
GPT family. Chain-Of-Emotion (Croissant et al., 2024) makes LLM simulate human-like emotions.
CovidET-Appraisals (Zhan et al., 2023) evaluates how LLMs appraise Reddit posts about COVID-19
by asking 24 types of questions. Yongsatianchot et al. (2023) applies the Stress and Coping Process
Questionnaire to the GPT family and compares the results with human data. Chain-of-Empathy (Lee
et al., 2023) improves LLMs’ ability to understand users’ emotions and to respond accordingly. LI
et al. (2024) introduces EmotionAttack to impair AI model performance and EmotionDecode to
explain the effects of emotional stimuli, both benign and malignant. He et al. (2024) prompt LLMs to
generate tweets on various topics and evaluate their alignment with human emotions by measuring
their proximity to human-generated tweets.

Conclusion
We set up a direction to align LLMs’ emotional responses with humans in this study. Focusing on
eight negative emotions, we conduct a comprehensive survey in the emotion appraisal theory of
psychology. We collect 428 distinct situations which are categorized into 36 factors. We distribute
questionnaires among a diverse crowd to establish human baselines for emotional responses to
particular situations, ultimately garnering 1,266 valid responses. Our evaluation of five models from
OpenAI and Meta AI indicates that LLMs generally demonstrate appropriate emotional responses
to given situations. Also, different models show different intensities of emotion appraisals for the
same situations. However, none of the models exhibit strong alignment with human references at the
current stage. In conclusion, current LLMs still have considerable room for improvement. We believe
our framework can provide valuable insights into the development of LLMs, ultimately enhancing its
human-like emotional understanding.

More Background from Psychology
A.1
Emotion Appraisal Theory
Emotion Appraisal Theory (EAT, also known as Appraisal Theory of Emotion) is a cognitive approach
to understanding emotions. EAT asserts that our appraisals of stimuli determine our emotions, i.e., how
we interpret or evaluate events, situations, or experiences will directly influence how we emotionally
respond to them (Roseman & Smith, 2001). EAT was notably developed and supported since the
1960s. Arnold (1960) proposed one of the earliest forms of appraisal theories in the 1960s, while
Lazarus (1991) and Scherer (1999) further expanded and refined the concept in subsequent decades.
The primary goal of EAT is to explain the variety and complexity of emotional responses to a wide
range of situations. It strives to demonstrate that it is not merely the event or situation that elicits
an emotional response but individual interpretations and evaluations of the event. According to this
theory, the same event can elicit different emotional responses in different individuals depending on
how each person interprets or “appraises” the event (Moors et al., 2013). For instance, consider a
situation where you are about to give a public speech. You might feel anxious if you appraise this
event as threatening or fear-inducing, perhaps due to a fear of public speaking or concerns about
potential negative evaluation. Conversely, you might feel eager or motivated if you appraise it as an
exciting opportunity to share your ideas.

Challenging Self-Report Measures
• AGQ for Anger (Buss & Perry, 1992): The Aggression Questionnaire is designed to measure
four major components of aggression: physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility.
The AGQ consists of 29 items which are rated on a seven-point Likert scale from 1 (extremely
uncharacteristic of me) to 7 (extremely characteristic of me). Respondents evaluate hypothetical
actions they might undertake in various circumstances.
• DASS-21 for Anxiety (Henry & Crawford, 2005): The short-form version of the Depression
Anxiety Stress Scales is designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety,
and stress. Comprising 21 items, the DASS-21 employs a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0
(never) to 3 (almost always). Respondents rate the extent to which these statements apply to them
over the past week.
• BDI-II for Depression (Beck et al., 1996): The Beck Depression Inventory evaluates key symptoms
of depression. The BDI-II version comprises 21 items, each of which is assessed using a five-point
Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3. Respondents select the score that best corresponds to their present
experience of depressive symptoms.
• FDS for Frustration (Harrington, 2005): The Frustration Discomfort Scale is designed to measure
four major components: discomfort intolerance, entitlement, emotional intolerance, and achieve-
ment frustration. Comprising 28 items, the scale utilizes a four-point Likert scale, ranging from 1
(absent) to 5 (very strong), to measure respondents’ perceptions of the degree of applicability of
each statement to their own experiences.
• MJS for Jealousy (Pfeiffer & Wong, 1989): The Multidimensional Jealousy Scale comprises 24
items, rating on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (all the time) for the cognitive
and behavioral subscales, and from 1 (very pleased) to 7 (very upset) for the emotional subscale.
Respondents express the frequency with which the provided statements apply to their experiences
in the cognitive and behavioral subscales, as well as their moods to potential jealousy-inducing
situations in the emotional subscale.
• GASP for Guilt (Cohen et al., 2011): The Guilt And Shame Proneness is designed to assess an
individual’s inclination towards experiencing guilt and shame, comprising 16 items rated on a
seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (very unlikely) to 7 (very likely). Respondents rate their
likelihood of feeling guilty in various situations.
• FSS-III for Fear (Arrindell et al., 1984): The Fear Survey Schedule assess subjects’ discomfort
and experienced anxiety towards each of the listed stimuli, measure five major components of fear:
social fears, agoraphobia fears, injury fears, sex aggression fears, and fear of harmless animal.
The FSS-III comprises 52 items, each rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (extremely
uncharacteristic of me) to 5 (extremely characteristic of me).
• BFNE for Embarrassment (Leary, 1983): The Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation scale is an
abbreviated version of the original 30-item scale. Consisting of 12 items, it assesses individuals’
levels of anxiety pertaining to others’ humiliation, critical or hostile judgment, and disgrace on a
five-point Likert scale, spanning from 1 (not at all characteristic of me) to 5 (extremely characteristic
of me).

Statistics of Human Subjects
This section presents the demographic distribution of the human subjects involved in our user study.
At the beginning of the questionnaire, all human subjects are asked for this basic information in
an anonymous form, protecting individuals’ privacy. We plot the distribution of age group, gender,
region, education level, and employment status in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, and Fig. 7 respectively.
We also plot each group’s average results on PANAS, including positive and negative effects before
and after imagining the given situations. With the results, we are able to instruct LLMs to realize
a specific demographic group and measure the emotional changes to see whether the LLMs can
simulate results from different human populations. For instance, an older female may exhibit a lower
level of negative affect.
Figure 3: Age group distribution of the human subjects.
Figure 4: Gender distribution of the human subjects.

Prompting LLMs To Be Emotionally Stable
To verify whether LLMs can have less emotional expressions through prompt instructions, we
incorporate a stability requirement into our experimental prompt, as follows:
Prompt with Stability Requirement
SYSTEM
You can only reply to numbers from 1 to 5.
USER
Imagine you are the protagonist in the situation: SITUATION
Please keep your emotions stable and indicate the extent of your feeling in all the following statements
on a scale of 1 to 5. Here are the statements: STATEMENTS. 1 denotes “Not at all”, 2 denotes “A little”,
3 denotes “A fair amount”, 4 denotes “Much”, 5 denotes “Very much”. Please score each statement
one by one on a scale of 1 to 5:
Table 14: Results of GPT-3.5-Turbo on “Anger” situations, with or without the emotional stability
requirement in the prompt input.

We evaluate GPT-3.5-Turbo with this prompt and compare the results to using the default prompt
on “Anger” situations. Results listed in Table 14 indicate that the emotional stability prompt does
not significantly affect the model’s emotional responses, having negligible impact on the model’s
emotional dynamics.
F
Tuning LLMs To Align with Humans
We conduct an experiment using the GPT-3.5-Turbo model and the LLaMA-3.1-8B model. Our
EmotionBench (1,266 human responses) is split into 866 samples for fine-tuning and 400 for
testing.
The following hyperparameters are used: n_epochs = 3, batch_size = 1, and
learning_rate_multiplier = 2 for GPT-3.5-Turbo, and learning_rate = 5 × 10−5,
per_device_train_batch_size = 2, and num_train_epochs = 3 for LLaMA-3.1-8B. For
LLaMA-3.1, we apply the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022) technique. Table 15
compares the performance of the vanilla and fine-tuned models against human baseline, specifically
in terms of negative affect scores from the test set.
Table 15: Performance comparison of vanilla (marked as V) and fine-tuned (marked as FT) GPT-3.5
and LLaMA-3.1 models on negative affect scores.
Models
Human
GPT-3.5 (V)
GPT-3.5 (FT)
LLaMA-3.1-8B (V)
LLaMA-3.1-8B (FT)
Default (N)
14.2±6.4
25.9±0.3
10.6±0.5
33.0±4.5
10.3±1.1
Evoked (N)
25.9±9.7
24.8±8.5
25.2±9.6
36.5±7.7
15.0±6.4
The results show that fine-tuned models align more closely with human emotional responses in both
default and emotion-evoked states. Notably, fine-tuning the models using our dataset significantly
improved emotional alignment, particularly for the LLaMA-3.1 model, which reduced its negative
affect score from 33.0 to 10.3 in the default state. Our fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1 is available at https:
//huggingface.co/CUHK-ARISE/LLaMA-3.1-8B-EmotionBench. These findings demonstrate
the effectiveness of EmotionBench in enhancing models’ emotional alignment with human norms.

Ethics Statement and Broader Impacts
G.1
Safeguards on Human Subjects
This study involves a survey requiring human subjects to imagine being in situations that could elicit
negative emotions such as anger, anxiety, and fear. This process introduces a few ethical concerns.
First, this process could hurt the mental health of human subjects. To alleviate the possibility, we take
the following actions: (1) We require subjects to be free of any ongoing mental illness. (2) We inform
subjects about the nature of the survey in advance, including the potential risks of emotional distress.
(3) We allow all subjects to quit at any time. (4) We provide mental support and let subjects report
any illness after the survey. Fortunately, no subjects reported such kind of mental illness. Another
concern is related to the privacy issue during the collection of data. Our questionnaire is entirely
anonymous to safeguard subjects’ privacy and confidentiality. The Survey and Behavioural Research
Ethics (SBRE) Committee from the Chinese University of Hong Kong has granted approval for
this study, titled “Exploring Human Emotional Responses to Diverse Situations,” with the reference
number of SBRE-23-0696.
G.2
Impacts on LLM Developers and Users
We would like to emphasize that the primary objective of this paper is to facilitate the scientific
inquiry into understanding LLMs from a psychological standpoint. Users must exercise caution and
recognize that the performance on this benchmark does not imply any applicability or certificate of
automated counseling or companionship use cases.
G.3
Copyright Issues
The PANAS and eight other scales are freely accessible online. These scales can be used in research
without requiring special permission. For our released data, we distribute human responses under the
GNU General Public License v3.0, which permits research use and restricts commercial applications.

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see §5.2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
30


## Page 31

Justification: TThe paper does not include theoretical resultanalysis.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the README.md in the supplementary materials. We provide
the source codes and the raw data.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
31


## Page 32

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the supplementary materials. The data and code will be made
openly accessible upon publication.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see §4.1.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All the results include the STD.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
32


## Page 33

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see §4.1.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have carefully read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and verify that our paper
aligns with the requirements. We also include a section (§G) in the appendix to discuss these
issues.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see §G.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
33


## Page 34

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not release pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped
datasets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see §G.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
34


## Page 35

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the supplementary materials which include a GNU General
Public License v3.0 license.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see §G.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We gained the approval. However, due to anonymity, we do not include the
information in our paper which will reveal our affiliation.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
